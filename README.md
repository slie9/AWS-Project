We developed an AWS-based web application that enables users to interact with a recipe database. The primary objective of the application is to provide users with a platform where they can browse, create, and manage their own recipes.

Users are required to sign up for an account to access the application's features. Once logged in, users can search for recipes by name and filter results based on tags that they have added to their recipes. The tags allow users to categorize recipes by dietary restrictions or meal types.

The application allows users to create and delete their own recipes. However, only the user who created a recipe can delete it. Users can also upload images to their recipes and mark their favorite recipes for future reference.

Overall, the application aims to simplify the recipe management process for users, providing a platform where they can easily organize, find, and share their favorite recipes.
