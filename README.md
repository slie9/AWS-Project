# Cloud-Computing
This project was the creation of an AWS web app that collected data about the user and let them interact with the database.

- The goal of this app is to allow users to interact with the recipe database.
- Users are able to sign up for an account and login to an existing account.
- They can search for recipes by name and create or delete their own recipes. Only the user can delete their own recipe.
- Users can add tags to their recipes to make it easier to categorize by diet or type of meal.
- The recipes can be filtered by the tags, for example if a recipe is tagged as vegetarian, you can search for vegetarian recipes by clicking on the tag.
- Users can also upload images to their recipes and favorite other recipes.
